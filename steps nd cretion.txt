🎯 Goal:

You want to:

Build a simple To-Do app in TypeScript

Turn it into a Progressive Web App (PWA) (installable)

Make it work in development (local testing)

Make it work in deployment (on GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.)

🧱 Step-by-Step Plan

We’ll build everything step by step, starting from folder structure.

📁 1. PROJECT FOLDER STRUCTURE

Create a folder like:

todo-pwa/
├── src/
│   └── script.ts          ← your TypeScript code
├── public/
│   ├── index.html         ← main HTML
│   ├── script.js          ← compiled JS (copied from dist)
│   ├── manifest.json      ← manifest for PWA
│   ├── sw.js              ← service worker
│   └── icons/             ← icons for install
│       ├── icon-192.png
│       └── icon-512.png
├── dist/                  ← auto-generated JS from TypeScript
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
